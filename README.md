# Layouts & Components

This is where I keep bits and pieces of code that I could reuse in other projects. Some of these are built from following along with tutorials, in which case, a link will be provided in code comments at the top.

Most of these are just bare bones and very simple, they are for practice and a starting point to integrate into larger projects.
